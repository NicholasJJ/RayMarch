# RayMarch
ray marching shader for unity. Shader takes input information from unity gameobject for easy manipulation, and uses a custom collision system to base collisions on what
the raymarcher is rendering. Also has some standard-issue raymarch goodies like reflections and smooth object additions/subtractions.
